      <h1>About the Platform</h1>
      <p>WasteX description:
        For any industry generating or using food waste look to be more sustainable
        & SDG-compliant, WasteX is a U.S. based system that tracks food across the supply chain,
        from production to consumption. Unlike TraceX, our system incentivizes companies
        to reduce food waste by generating tradable tokens for companies that demonstrate
        food waste reduction practices.

      <h1>How it Works</h1>
      <p>Our platform works by creating unique tokens for each step of the food production and distribution process.
        These tokens are created and exchanged on our secure blockchain network, allowing us to track the movement of
        food products in real-time. By incentivizing participants to reduce waste and emissions, we can create a more
        sustainable food system for all.</p>
