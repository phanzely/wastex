      <h1>About the Platform</h1>
      <p>The Food Waste Blockchain Platform is a revolutionary new technology that allows food producers, distributors,
        and retailers to track the entire lifecycle of their products from farm to table. By using blockchain
        technology, we can ensure that every step of the process is transparent and secure, reducing waste and carbon
        emissions along the way.</p>

    <section id="how-it-works">
      <h1>How it Works</h1>
      <p>Our platform works by creating unique tokens for each step of the food production and distribution process.
        These tokens are created and exchanged on our secure blockchain network, allowing us to track the movement of
        food products in real-time. By incentivizing participants to reduce waste and emissions, we can create a more
        sustainable food system for all.</p>
